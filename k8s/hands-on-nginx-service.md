To deploy an Nginx web server as a Kubernetes Deployment and expose it as a Service, follow these hands-on steps:

1. **Create a Deployment:**
   Create a YAML file (e.g., `nginx-deployment.yaml`) to define the Nginx Deployment. Below is an example of a simple Deployment definition:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: nginx-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: nginx
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: nginx
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: nginx
           image: nginx:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

   Apply the Deployment definition using `kubectl`:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Create a Service:**
   Create a YAML file (e.g., `nginx-service.yaml`) to define the Nginx Service. Below is an example of a simple Service definition:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: nginx-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: nginx
     ports:
     - protocol: TCP
       port: 80
       targetPort: 80
   ```

   Apply the Service definition using `kubectl`:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   Check if the Deployment pods are running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

4. **Access Nginx Service:**
   If your Kubernetes cluster supports NodePort type Services, you can access the Nginx Service from outside the cluster using the assigned NodePort.

   For example, if the Service is of type NodePort and has been assigned port `32000`, you can access it using any node's IP address and port `32000`.

5. **Clean Up:**
   If you no longer need the Deployment and Service, you can delete them:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
   kubectl delete service nginx-service
   ```
