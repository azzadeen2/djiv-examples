To set up GitHub Actions for a Java application, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create GitHub Workflow:**
   Create a directory named `.github/workflows` in the root of your GitHub repository if it doesn't already exist.

2. **Create Workflow YAML File:**
   Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a YAML file (e.g., `java-ci.yml`) to define your GitHub Actions workflow. Below is an example of a basic workflow for building a Java application using Maven:

   ```yaml
   name: Java CI

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Set up JDK 11
         uses: actions/setup-java@v2
         with:
           java-version: '11'

       - name: Build with Maven
         run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml
   ```

   This workflow will trigger on every push to the `main` branch, set up JDK 11, and build the Java application using Maven.

3. **Commit and Push:**
   Commit the workflow YAML file to your repository and push the changes to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/java-ci.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for Java CI"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **View Workflow Execution:**
   Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to see the status and details of the workflow execution.

5. **Customize Workflow:**
   You can customize the workflow YAML file to include additional steps such as running tests, deploying the application, or publishing artifacts.

6. **Explore GitHub Actions Marketplace:**
   Explore the GitHub Actions Marketplace for pre-built actions and workflows that you can use to automate various tasks in your Java project.
